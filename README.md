# Digital Portfolio Website

This is my digital portfolio, which is currently still a work in progress. It uses HTML, CSS and plain JavaScript, all written by me. The portfolio includes some information about me and my skills, and later on I will add some of my programming projects into it. 

The **deployed website** can be found [here](https://ainoal.github.io/portfolio_website/).

The website is responsive to the size of the browser window, and thus it should scale to different-sized devices.

## Development

As a huge language enthusiast, I am currently working on adding multiple language options to the site. I also plan on polishing the overall appearance of the site.

## Testing

The website has been tested with Firefox 84, Edge 88, Firefox 84 and Chrome 88 browsers. Due to some problems with loading pages in different languages on Chrome and Firefox, I have temporarily disabled language options until I fix the bug.
